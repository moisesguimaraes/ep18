# Hardening Plaintext Secrets in Configuration Files

Many applications and services rely on configuration data to be able to interact with each other and to function according to its purpose. Plaintext configuration files are widely used to separate configuration from code as configuration data varies substantially across deployments while code does not.

OpenStack Common Libraries (Oslo) provides an enhanced alternative to Python's standard module ConfigParser called [oslo.config]. It supports configuration files, command line arguments, option deprecation, and much more.

The motivation of this work is to give oslo.config the ability to fetch sensitive configuration data (secrets) from places that are better equipped to deal with them.

Problem Description

Best practices say that passwords and other secret values should not be stored as plain text in configuration files and some regulations might even enforce this practice as mandatory.

Although we can rely on file system permissions to restrict access to a configuration file, its content can still be accidentally shared, checked into revision control, or printed to a console or log file, without having all sensitive data stripped out of it.

Also, with the popularization of containers and public clouds, there is a higher concern about data getting compromised as we don't know what else might be running on the same machine.

## Proposed Solutioin

There are proper solutions for storing this kind of sensitive data called secret managers. They have features to handle access control, password rotation, data encryption/decryption, X.509 certificates and can also interface with Hardware Security Modules (HSM) if the security requirements are set that high.

OpenStack has its own secret manager service called Barbican, and HashiCorp Vault is one of the best opensource solutions out there. Both are very interesting options to connect oslo.config to, but to provide more flexibility, we defined an API for backend drivers in oslo.config, so it could easily integrate with more options in the future.

In a few words, a config option in oslo.config is identified by its name and group, when the group is not defined, the option automatically belongs to the DEFAULTgroup. We can see a sample config file with two options below, one belonging to the DEFAULT group and another to the credentials group:

```ini
[DEFAULT]
foo = bar

[credentials]
username = admin
password =  maZ4uFtJUqyA
```

A new configuration option DEFAULT.config_source is added to define extra sources of configuration data. The value for config_source is a list of source identifiers used to find configuration settings for other sources. Each source identifier corresponds to a configuration option group, which provides the details for a single source of configuration data.

Each config group representing an extra config source must have an option named driver to identify the proper drive to handle it.

When oslo.config looks for an option value, it goes through the defined sources in the order they are provided, starting with the command line, then any configuration files, and finally the sources loaded from config_source. The first source that provides a configured value for an option causes the search to end.

## Proof of Concept

The Proof of Concept (PoC) of this work aimed to fulfill the following criteria:

  1. Implement a simple driver to fetch remote configuration data;
  2. Strip out secrets from a configuration file;
  3. Store secrets in a new configuration source;
  4. Give oslo.config the ability to fetch those secrets.

We created the remote_file driver to fetch and parse extra configuration files from an http[s] server with the following options.

driver = remote_file
  The name of the driver that can load this configuration source.
  
uri
  Required option with the URI of the extra configuration file's location.
  
ca_path
  The path to a CA_BUNDLE file or directory with certificates of  trusted CAs.

client_cert
  Client side certificate, as a single file path containing either the certificate only or the private key and the certificate.

client_key
  Client side private key, in case client_cert is specified but does not include the private key.

We can see on the PoC Scenarios session how the configuration files look like before and after the usage of the remote_file driver.

## Conclusions

By fetching secrets from other sources, one can include extra layers of protection to them and take advantage of features provided by secret managers.

Using the remote_file driver in its full capability, it is possible to deny access to secrets by revoking the certificate of a compromised deployment. This requires each deployment to have its own certificate, and SSL/TLS client authentication on the HTTP server.

Having the secrets to live in a single place also makes the process of password rotation easier as the new password only has to be updated in one place instead of in all configuration files that requires it.

The lifespan of a deployment's certificate can be reduced to enforce secrets leasing for a short time period and minimize the attack window using compromised keys.

## Future Work

[Castellan] is a generic key manager interface developed by the Barbican team. It enables projects to use a configurable key manager that can be deployment specific.

The next step in our roadmap is to create an oslo.config driver for Castellan. This will give oslo.config the capability to retrieve secrets from all of the key manager solutions supported by Castellan, giving access to Barbican or HashiCorp Vault through a single driver implementation.

Direct drivers to Barbican or HashiCorp Vault can also be implemented, but as far as oslo.config doesnâ€™t require features other than retrieval of secrets, it makes sense to use Castellan as the lowest-common-denominator instead.

Developers interested in using another solution as an extra source of configuration data can implement their own drivers following this [spec].
